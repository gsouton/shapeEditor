# shapeEditor

This is a small example implementing the designs patterns Abstract Factory, Decorator and 
Prototype.

The purpose here is to abstract general operations on shapes such as rotation, 
scaling, display etc...


To do that we abstracted and reduced shapes to a small number of functionalities.
We have an interface defining which operation a user can do with a shape, and all the 
code that are using different libraries for rendering is abstracted from the user
